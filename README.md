## ⚙️ How It Works

When you add a video, Edit Mind runs a complete **AI-powered local analysis pipeline**:

1. **🎙 Full Transcription** — Extracts and transcribes the audio track using a local [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model for time-stamped dialogue.  
2. **🎞 Scene Segmentation** — Splits the video into 2-second “Scenes” for precise frame-level indexing.  
3. **🧩 Deep Frame Analysis** — Each Scene is analyzed by Python plugins to:
   - Recognize faces  
   - Detect objects  
   - Perform OCR (on-screen text)  
   - Analyze colors and composition  
4. **🧠 Data Consolidation** — Aligns spoken text with visual content using timestamps.  
5. **🔍 Vector Embedding & Storage** — All extracted data (transcripts, tags, and metadata) are embedded using local models and stored locally in **[ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/)**.  
6. **🗣 Semantic Search Parsing** — When you search in natural language (e.g. _“show me all clips where Ilias looks happy”_), Edit Mind uses local models to convert your search prompt into a structured JSON query.  
   This query is then executed locally against the ChromaDB vector store to retrieve relevant scenes.

## ✨ Features

### Downloading Models

Before running the application, you need to download the required AI models for local processing.

1.  Create a `models` directory in the project root.
2.  Download the following models and place them in the `models` directory:

    - **Llama- (for a prompt to a search query):**
        - [Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/hugging-quants/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-3.2-3b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf)

Your `models` directory should look like this:

```
/models
├── Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

### Running the Application

With the setup complete, you can start the application.

```bash
npm run start
```

## 🏗️ Building for Production

To create a distributable package for your operating system, use the build command:

```bash
npm run build:mac
```

This will generate an installer or executable in the `out/` directory, configured according to `electron-builder.yml`.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized to maintain a clear separation of concerns:

- `app/`: Contains all the React frontend code (pages, components, hooks, styles). This is the renderer process.
- `lib/`: Contains the core Electron application logic.
  - `main/`: The Electron main process entry point and core backend services.
  - `preload/`: The preload script for securely bridging the main and renderer processes.
  - `conveyor/`: A custom-built, type-safe IPC (Inter-Process Communication) system.
  - `services/`: Node.js services that orchestrate tasks like calling Python scripts.
- `python/`: Home to all Python scripts for AI/ML analysis, transcription, and more.
- `resources/`: Static assets that are not part of the web build, like the application icon.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project was bootstrapped from the excellent [guasam/electron-react-app](https://github.com/guasam/electron-react-app) template. It provided a solid foundation with a modern Electron, React, and Vite setup, which allowed us to focus on building the core features of Edit Mind.

## ⚠️ Known Challenges & Areas for Contribution

While the core architecture is robust, the project is still in early development. Contributions are welcome in solving these key challenges to make the app production-ready.

1.  **Application Packaging & Distribution:**
    The current setup is developer-focused. A major goal is to create a seamless, one-click installer for non-technical users. This involves bundling the Python environment, ML models, and all dependencies into the final Electron application for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Contributions in this area (e.g., using PyInstaller, managing model downloads) are highly welcome.

2.  **Performance on Consumer Hardware:**
    The analysis pipeline is resource-intensive. While the code includes memory monitoring and optimizations, further work is needed to ensure smooth operation on a variety of consumer-grade machines. Key areas for improvement include:
    *   Implementing a robust background queuing system for video processing.
    *   Adding user-configurable "analysis levels" (e.g., "transcription only" vs. "full analysis").
    *   Further optimization of the frame processing and ML inference steps.

3.  **Data Schema Evolution:**
    As new plugins and features are added, the metadata schema for scenes will evolve. A long-term challenge is to implement a strategy for handling data migrations, allowing users to "upgrade" their existing indexed data to a new schema without having to re-index their entire library from scratch.
